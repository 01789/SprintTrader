UDK License
	$99 developer license and 25% of profits* after $50,000 in gross income from UDK-related things
	The developer license is not per-seat and covers all games made - the gross income is calculated for each game - so if 2 games make $30,000 each the 25% royalty is owed on $10,000.
	The $99 is not owed until the product is released - no money is owed during development.

UE4 License
	$19/month and 5% of profits*
	The monthly subscription is per-seat, no obligation. The subscription must be purchased before development can begin.
	
*Profits are defined as game-specific income, so income from Kickstarter campaigns in which there is a pledge reward that is greater than the cost of the game (i.e. game retails for $10, pledge reward tier is $100) only the game retail is included in the revenue (that $100 would mean you would owe $2.50 if you had already earned more than $50,000 if you use UDK, or $0.50 if you were using UE4.
