Google Play
Browsing the various (Action, Adventure, RPG, Simulation, Strategy) categories of games on the Google Play store revealed nothing in the same vein as Sprint Trader in the top paid games. There are LOADS of superhero games in the free section, shooters a close second. Again, nothing similar to ST.

More targeted searches reveal several games listed below:
Search Term: Space
	Space Wars 3D (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shinybox.sw3d)
		- 3D arcade shooter (Starfox)
		- Free
		- Bright colors
		- Power ups
		- Little in common with ST
		- Received well
	Space Shuttle Launch (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simulabs.spacelaunch)
		- Simulation
		- Free
		- Doesn't appear to do much of anything
		- Received poorly
	Space Racing 3D (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.racergame.flycar)
		- Arcade racer
		- Free with IAP
		- Multiple ships (~6)
		- Multiple racetracks (+40)
		- 3 game modes
		- Reviews seem largely good, but monetization a problem
		- Again, little in common with ST, but the multiple hulls and variants seem popular
	Cold Space (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameforge.nogame)
		- Top-down arcade shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Made in Unity - I recognize the Detonator package from the store.
		- Hectic, not similar to ST
		- Well-reviewed
	Space RPG (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=meister.game.spacerpg)
		- Simulation? Listed as "Arcade" Hard to tell given the information in the store
		- Free with IAP
		- Closest to ST so far. I should probably play this.
	Razor Run - 3D Space Shooter (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vg.razorrun)
		- 3D arcade shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Weird camera angle
		- Another fairly generic space shooter that runs at very poor resolution
	Star-Draft: Space Control (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.solargames.sdsc)
		- 3D Space Shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Another Unity-based game. I recognize Detonator again.
		- It's hard to judge by the video but this may be another game to play.
	Space Corsair (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.testudo.spacecorsair)
		- Top-down arcade shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Is that remixed Pirates of the Caribbean music in the trailer?
		- Seems like a good way to do the combat in ST if that direction is the way we want to go.
	There were many more results but I didn't want to look at everything.
Search Term: Starship (Based on a few results this search term is not nearly as productive...)
	Starship Runner (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radioactivewasp.starshiprunner)
		- Top-down Arcade Shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- VERY low production quality, assets are 90% gradients.
		- Multiple ships
	Starship Battle (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=starship.battle.game)
		- Top-down arcade shooter
		- Free
		- Low production quality, looks like bad student work
		- A bit FTL-like.
	Interstellar Pilot (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelfactor.interstellarpilot)
		- 3D Space Shooter/Sim
		- Free with IAP
		- Offers a variety of ships
		- Clunky UI
		- Looks complex and interesting.
		- I should probably play this one too.
Search Term: Trader, Refined to: Trader in Games
	Star Traders RPG (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.corytrese.games.startraders)
		- Spreadsheet-based space RPG
		- Free with paid version
		- Grid-based movement through the quadrant
		- Large-scale sales
		- Pirate battles
		- Crew provides bonuses
		- 500+ ships
		- This is definitely one I should play.
	Space Trader (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackcatslab.spacetrader)
		- Spreadsheet-based RPG
		- Free
		- Low-quality game that is just a fancy spreadsheet (based on two screenshots)
		- Similar in some ways, probably, to ST, but probably not worth playing
	Pirates and Traders (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.micabyte.android.pirates)
		- Spreadsheet-based pirate RPG
		- Free
		- Different than the others - it's an earth-pirate setting
		- Text-based combat and RPG elements
		- VERY dense UI
		- Seems like decent production quality (compared to some others) but still low overall.
		
iTunes App Store
The construction of the App store seems a little better for finding the information that I'm looking for. No games similar to ST concept in the first 150 top paid games, same in the top 150 free games.

Looking through categories, selecting the "What's hot" section to get an idea for what is being downloaded and played now. Free and paid are mixed together. Nothing in Action, Adventure, Role playing, Simulation. One in Strategy.

The overwhelming majority of games across all categories were fantasy-themed with a fair number of modern-set games. There was a distinct lack of futuristic games present. There were more abstracted or re-made card games than there were science-fiction-type games.

Found via "What we're playing" option
	Star Horizon (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-horizon/id814466047?mt=8)
		- 3D space shooter (Rails)
		- $3.99
		- It looks nice
		- Ship upgrades
		- Branching (?) storyline
		- Should look up videos
Found via "Strategy" category search
	Galaxy Legend (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/galaxy-legend/id599877646?mt=8)
		- Isometric space RTS/RTS civ-building game
		- Free with IAP
		- Little information in the store overall, it appears that you must download to get complete info on the game.
		- May be worth playing?
