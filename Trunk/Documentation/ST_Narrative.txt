In the year 2330, almost 2,000 years ago humanity invented warp drives capable of traveling faster than light by riding a wave of spacetime towards their destination. While the technology is far outdated by more modern blink drives or translation drives it was instrumental in the expansion of humanity across the stars.

Thus began the Age of Expansion. The next thousand years saw hundreds more colonization missions sent. It was slow going, some missions failed before they reached their target planets, some found their target planets entirely inhospitable, some fell to infighting, mechanical failure, natural disasters, or any of a thousand small, but crucial system failures. The planets settled took another few hundred years before they were sufficiently terraformed to support permanent settlements.

In the end humans settled in four different systems: Sol (0.0 ly), Kepler 186f (492 ly), Tau Ceti (11.9 ly), and Gliese 667 (23.6 ly). Since then numerous expeditions have been sent without the express purpose of colonization, but merely exploration and tagging then leaving Blink Buoys behind for future travel.

Historians and politicians insist that the Second Age of Expansion is on us, but the general populace doesn't see the reason for public spending on human expansion, corporations are choosing to participate, however, leading to interesting arguments about jurisdiction, ownership, and the rights of colonists.

That's all well and good, but the history of the universe doesn't concern you much. Captaining a Sprint Trader is a respectable job, it can be lucrative too.
