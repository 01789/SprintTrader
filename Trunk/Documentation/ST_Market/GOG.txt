Great Old Games (gog.com)
GoG's search feature makes it very difficult to find the things I'm looking for... I was looking in the wrong place. Much better now.

Either the search feature is very literal or there are very few games matching my search terms. Nothing that appeared relevant under "space" and no results for either "Starship" or "Trader"

After searching a few more items it appears that there isn't any good way besides a good ol' crawl through their library. I'm going to crawl through the Sim category and leave it there - if I can't find anything then fine.

Zero. Moving on.
