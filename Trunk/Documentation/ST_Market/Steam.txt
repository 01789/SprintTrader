Steam App (Steam Store)
This is a dramatically different ballgame. The previous explorations have been of mobile-only platforms. Steam is a PC-only platform (with the exception of the forthcoming Steambox, which will run Linux... so it's really not that different) This platform will expand the capabilities of the game and afford a greater flexibility of scope and control scheme.

It's worth nothing that right away there are two games in the scrolling header window that have some relevance: Kerbal Space Program (KSP) and Space Engineers. (During the time of writing the feed updated to include FTL: Advanced Edition, a free update that includes a great deal more content)

Based on preliminary research it appears that there are quite a few more games in the genre on the PC than on mobile devices. There is probably a good reason - most of these games are monstrously complex; there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of things for the player to know and keep track of. That means there are a lot of specific controls that must be used and a lot of specific information that must be relayed via the UI to the player, both of those things are fairly difficult to get right on a phone. Additionally these games are typically meant for long play sessions (with the exception of FTL, maybe?) and mobile platforms are not conducive to long-term games.
