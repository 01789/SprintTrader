Google Play
Browsing the various (Action, Adventure, RPG, Simulation, Strategy) categories of games on the Google Play store revealed nothing in the same vein as Sprint Trader in the top paid games. There are LOADS of superhero games in the free section, shooters a close second. Again, nothing similar to ST.

More targeted searches reveal several games listed below:
Search Term: Space
	Space Wars 3D (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shinybox.sw3d)

	Cold Space (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameforge.nogame)
		- Top-down arcade shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Made in Unity - I recognize the Detonator package from the store.
		- Hectic, not similar to ST
		- Well-reviewed
	Space RPG (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=meister.game.spacerpg)
		- Simulation? Listed as "Arcade" Hard to tell given the information in the store
		- Free with IAP
		- Closest to ST so far. I should probably play this.
	Razor Run - 3D Space Shooter (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vg.razorrun)
		- 3D arcade shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Weird camera angle

	Star-Draft: Space Control (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.solargames.sdsc)
		- 3D Space Shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Another Unity-based game. I recognize Detonator again.
		- It's hard to judge by the video but this may be another game to play.
	Space Corsair (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.testudo.spacecorsair)
		- Top-down arcade shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- Is that remixed Pirates of the Caribbean music in the trailer?
		- Seems like a good way to do the combat in ST if that direction is the way we want to go.
	There were many more results but I didn't want to look at everything.
Search Term: Starship (Based on a few results this search term is not nearly as productive...)
	Starship Runner (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radioactivewasp.starshiprunner)
		- Top-down Arcade Shooter
		- Free with IAP
		- VERY low production quality, assets are 90% gradients.
		- Multiple ships
	Starship Battle (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=starship.battle.game)
		- Top-down arcade shooter
		- Free
		- Low production quality, looks like bad student work

		- 3D Space Shooter/Sim
		- Free with IAP

		- Spreadsheet-based RPG
		- Free
		- Low-quality game that is just a fancy spreadsheet (based on two screenshots)

	Pirates and Traders (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.micabyte.android.pirates)
